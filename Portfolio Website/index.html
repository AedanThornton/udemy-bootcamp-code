        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>
            I am an Eagle Scout and graduate from St. Olaf College with a strong creative mindset that lends me to being 
            a good problem solver who is open-minded and learns new things very quickly. I strive for quality in everything
            I do and I am always looking to improve and work off of feedback. I work well whether I’m on my own or I’m on a team.
